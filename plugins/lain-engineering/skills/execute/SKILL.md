  ZzzOps v0.0.0-dev — development plugin. Execute the primary ZzzOps goal loop:
  work all goals, continue, resume, triage, prioritize, reprioritize, unblock,
  verify, commit, refill, and report. Default executes authorized work. "dry run",
  "preview", or "plan" performs read-only queue analysis with no writes. Not
  one-off untracked work.

# Execute ZzzOps

Mode: `dry run`, `preview`, or `plan` means read-only inventory, triage simulation, ordering, and blocker reporting; do not initialize/apply, claim, update goals, edit source, run mutating commands, or change Git/external state. Otherwise run the live loop below.

First run `../../rules/INITIALIZATION.md`, then route through `../../rules/BACKENDS.md`. Read `../../rules/GOAL_SYSTEM.md` and the initialized charter; load only what applies.
Track execute intent through `../../rules/CONTINUATION.md` so additive capture can safely resume without nested loops.

Goals labeled `zzzops-feedback` are excluded by default. Include them only when the user explicitly approves inclusion for the current execution session; invocation approval counts, one approval covers all feedback goals, and expires with the session. Never ask per issue. Preserve the choice on every checkpoint/portfolio refresh by using `--include-feedback` only in an approved session.

- Unblock and persist unanswered requests: [UNBLOCK.md](references/UNBLOCK.md) and `../../rules/BLOCKERS.md`.
- Select/execute/complete/handoff: [EXECUTE.md](references/EXECUTE.md).
- Source-changing branch topology/review: [BRANCH_REVIEW.md](references/BRANCH_REVIEW.md).
- Pre-handoff diff/dead-code review: [SELF_REVIEW.md](references/SELF_REVIEW.md).
- Tests, delegation, parallelism, or long commands: `../../rules/EXECUTION_STRATEGY.md`.
- Exhausted-queue backlog suggestions: `$suggest-work` when explicitly enabled by reviewed PROJECT policy.

Apply PROJECT throughout. Before writes assess [[bounded commitment]](../../concepts/bounded-commitment.md); before switching/stopping persist resumable state. Continue while policy permits [[safe useful work]](../../concepts/safe-useful-work.md); optimize verified value, not count.

Before source work, read PROJECT Git/review/continuation policy and checkpoint only pending local ZzzOps state when required; never absorb unrelated changes or create an empty GitHub-state commit.

Before stopping or handing off, apply `../../rules/FEEDBACK.md`.
