# Plan bootstrap as ordinary ZzzOps goals

Use this stage only after the product brief and policy approval. It creates the canonical product/harness DAG; it does not scaffold, execute goals, or maintain a private checklist. Classification and harness planning add no approval gate.

## Establish one product root

1. Refresh the canonical portfolio and find an adequate parentless goal that owns the supplied product outcome and measurable acceptance boundary. Reconcile and reuse it when its human scope matches; do not duplicate or silently choose between divergent near-matches.
2. If none exists, create exactly one top-level product-outcome goal before any harness goal. Record beneficiaries, observable success, scope/non-goals, initial milestone, critical constraints, effective-rigor risks, high-commitment choices, and authority blockers. The root is durable product context, not a private bootstrap record.
3. Put harness outcomes and product milestones beneath this root. A second top-level product goal, a harness goal without the root, or a root that only says “bootstrap repository” is invalid.

## Build the harness DAG

1. Reuse the refreshed portfolio for duplicate, ancestry, cycle, status, claim, and implementation checks. Treat the product brief, reviewed policy, and repository evidence as inputs, not a generic template.
2. Select only justified, independently useful outcomes. Possible outcomes include pinned toolchain, repository structure, architecture boundaries, tests, formatting/lint/types, dependency/security checks, canonical verification, CI equivalence, deterministic guardrails, concise `AGENTS.md`, architecture context, and an initial product milestone. Omit anything without a beneficiary, risk reduction, or feedback value.
3. Express every selected outcome as an ordinary managed goal using `$add-goal` semantics. Each leaf needs observable acceptance evidence, the smallest real probe, resources, explicit dependencies, and risk inputs from which effective rigor is derived. Never persist a second effective-rigor value.
4. Order dependencies by usable outcomes, not implementation steps. Canonical verification depends on the checks it composes; CI depends on canonical verification; product implementation depends on the harness outcomes it needs. Bootstrap goals must not depend on the product goals they unlock.
5. Create the smallest executable initial product milestone under the root. PLAN does not implement it; the following ordinary execution loop does. Existing TODO/backlog import belongs to `$migrate`.

## Reconcile existing goals

After the root and harness goals have stable identities, inspect each open goal. Attach an unparented, unstarted goal to the root only when it clearly implements the same product outcome; preserve existing valid parents. Add the minimum required harness dependencies when all are true:

- it represents product/repository implementation affected by the harness;
- implementation has not started: no claim, branch, checkpoint, or completed source work;
- it is not a bootstrap goal, ZzzOps administration, feedback, release-only human action, or another non-implementation outcome;
- the new edge is not already present and cannot create a dependency or parent cycle.

Preserve priority, blockers, human text, and unrelated dependencies. Report an already-started goal or ambiguous ownership as a conflict; never rewrite it silently. A goal blocked on a product decision may receive a harness dependency only when that does not imply the decision is resolved.

## Resumability and idempotence

Before each write, recheck exact revision/digest and duplicate intent. Create goals in dependency order, recording their canonical IDs before dependents. Apply existing-goal edge updates separately after creation. On interruption, resume from canonical outcomes and IDs: reuse exact matches, repair only missing safe edges, and reject divergent near-duplicates or cycles. Repeating the completed stage creates no goals and changes no revisions.

## Fixtures

Greenfield structured API beneath one product root:

```text
Pin runtime
  → Establish project structure and architecture
    → Establish tests and static analysis
      → Establish canonical verification
        → Add equivalent CI
          → Implement first product milestone through ordinary execution
```

Brownfield library with working build/tests/CI but an incomplete verification command:

```text
Repair canonical verification to compose existing gates
  → Add the missing evidenced architecture guardrail
```

Preserve the established package layout and CI. Applicable unstarted product goals depend on the repair; an in-progress release, feedback goal, human portal task, and bootstrap goals remain unchanged. A retry reuses both harness goals and adds no duplicate edges.
